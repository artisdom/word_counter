To count a file's words:

    $ word_counter ./path/to/my/file.txt

Use the `-s` switch to also report which lines contained the counted word (can result in lot of text output, so you might want to pipe it to `less`):

    $ word_counter www.example.com -s | less
    Results:
    2 Domain
        1: Example Domain
